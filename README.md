# World Mining Commodities - SQL Analysis Project

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the global mining industry using SQL, providing hands-on experience with real-world data. The dataset consists of two tables: one containing information about mining companies and their operations, and the other detailing the country-level mining statistics for 65 commodities from 2018 to 2022.

By using SQL, this project aims to explore mining trends, assess company performance, and derive insights from the production data across different countries and commodities.

### Objective:
- To understand and analyze global mining trends, commodity production levels, and company operations.
- To practice SQL skills by answering interview-level questions ranging from basic to advanced queries.

## Datasets:
1. **116_world_mining_companies_clean.csv**: Contains data on 116 mining companies, including details on their operations, commodities, and project stages.
2. **world_mining_commodities_clean.csv**: Provides country-level production data for 65 mining commodities across 169 countries from 2018 to 2022.

## Key Skills Practiced:
- Data cleaning and structuring
- SQL queries (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Aggregating and joining data from multiple tables
- Data analysis and trend evaluation

## Questions Addressed:
The project includes a series of **30 SQL questions**, categorized as basic, intermediate, and advanced, designed to simulate real-world data analysis tasks.

### Basic SQL Questions:
1. List all unique commodities mined by companies.
2. Retrieve the names and websites of all companies operating in Canada.
3. List countries where 'Gold' was mined in 2022.
4. Find the total production of 'Copper' for the year 2020.
5. Display the name and project stage of companies involved in Diamond mining.

### Intermediate SQL Questions:
1. Calculate the total revenue generated by all companies mining 'Gold' from 2018 to 2022.
2. Find the top 5 countries with the highest total production of all commodities in 2022.
3. Retrieve the names of companies operating in both 'Canada' and 'Peru'.
4. Identify the commodity with the highest average production per country from 2018 to 2022.
5. List the top 3 project stages by the number of companies.

### Advanced SQL Questions:
1. Identify the top 3 companies contributing to the highest revenue for 'Diamonds' in 2021.
2. Rank countries based on their average production of 'Silver' between 2018 and 2022.
3. Find companies involved in mining commodities that were never mined in their operational countries.
4. Calculate the percentage contribution of each company to the global production of 'Nickel' in 2020.
5. List the commodities mined by companies operating in more than 3 countries and producing over 100,000 tons annually.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [GitHub link]`
2. Load the datasets into your SQL database.
3. Run the queries provided to explore the data.

## Conclusion:
This project allows you to practice SQL skills in a meaningful context while uncovering insights about the global mining industry. It's an excellent resource for anyone looking to develop a deeper understanding of SQL queries and data analysis.
